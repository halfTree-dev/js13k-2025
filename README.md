# Prologue
Rin was once one of the 13th century’s most powerful sorceresses. Cursed by the Cat Witch Cauchy during a mission, she became a black cat of misfortune and was locked in Cauchy’s basement.

But Rin’s magic was strong. She broke the curse, mastering the cat’s bad luck. Now she can shift between human and cat forms, using the black cat’s misfortune to turn enemies’ attacks back on them.

Now, you must guide Rin. Help her escape Cauchy’s basement and defeat the evil Cat Witch.
